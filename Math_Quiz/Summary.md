| **Objective**                  | Create an interactive math quiz application to test and enhance users' basic math skills in operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and fractions. |
| **Key Features**               | - Randomly generated math problems for practice in four-digit addition/subtraction, three-digit multiplication, and fraction operations.  |
| **Technology Used**            | Python with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).                                                                              |
| **Functionality**              | - Displays math problems in a table format.<br>- Allows users to input answers and provides real-time feedback on accuracy.<br>- Tracks and scores user performance. |
| **Difficulty Levels**          | Includes different problem types to cater to various skill levels (basic arithmetic and fraction operations).                           |
| **Example Problem**            | **Problem:** 452 + 789 = ?<br>**User Input:** 1241<br>**Feedback:** Correct!                                                             |
| **Scoring System**             | Real-time scoring based on correct answers, providing instant feedback to encourage learning and improvement.                            |
| **Future Enhancements**        | - Add timed quizzes for a challenge.<br>- Include a leaderboard or performance tracking over time.<br>- Expand problem types (e.g., division). |
