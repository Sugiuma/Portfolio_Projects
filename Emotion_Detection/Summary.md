## Project Summary

| **Aspect**                     | **Details**                                                                                                                               |

| **Objective**                  | Develop an app that uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect and analyze the emotional tone of user text inputs, identifying emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. |
| **Key Features**               | - Analyzes text input to detect emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust.<br>- Provides insights into the underlying sentiment or mood of the text.<br>- Leverages IBM Watson's NLP capabilities for accurate emotion detection. |
| **Technology Used**            | Python for backend development, IBM Watson NLP API for emotion analysis, Flask (optional for web-based app), Tkinter (optional for GUI). |
| **NLP Techniques**             | Uses sentiment analysis and emotion detection models powered by IBM Watson's NLP services to process text inputs and classify emotional tones. |
| **User Interface**             | Text input field for users to submit their text, with a display area for the app to show the detected emotion and confidence level. |
| **Example Input**              | **User Input:** "I am so happy today!"<br>**Detected Emotion:** Joy (Confidence: 95%)                                                      |
| **Use Case**                   | - Users can type or paste text into the app, and the system will return the most likely emotion detected along with the confidence level. |
| **Future Enhancements**        | - Expand emotion detection to include more nuanced emotions.<br>- Implement voice recognition for emotion detection from speech.<br>- Integrate with chatbot platforms for real-time emotion-based interactions. |
