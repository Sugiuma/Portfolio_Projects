| **Objective**                  | Develop a family routine tracker application to track and manage daily activities and tasks for each family member.                      |
| **Key Features**               | - Track daily activities for each family member.<br>- Generate dynamic reports on family activity participation.<br>- Visualize time spent on different activities using graphs (e.g., matplotlib). |
| **Technology Used**            | Python, Tkinter (GUI), Excel (data storage), matplotlib (visualizations).                                                                 |
| **Core Classes**               | - **FamilyMember**: Represents each family member with details like name, age, and assigned activities.<br>- **Activity**: Manages activities with attributes like name, duration, and frequency. |
| **Data Management**            | - Uses Excel files to store and retrieve family member and activity data.<br>- Allows for activity tracking and historical data analysis. |
| **User Interface**             | A GUI built using Tkinter, allowing family members to input activities, view schedules, and generate reports.                           |
| **Visualization**              | Activity data visualized through bar charts and pie charts to show time allocation for each family member.                               |
| **Example Use Case**           | - A family member logs their activities (e.g., exercise, study time, chores) throughout the day.<br>- The system generates a report to show how each member spent their time. |
| **Future Enhancements**        | - Add reminders and notifications for daily tasks.<br>- Integrate with cloud storage for syncing across devices.<br>- Allow for multiple families to use the app simultaneously. |
