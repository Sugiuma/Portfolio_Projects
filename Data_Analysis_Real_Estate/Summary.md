| **Objective**                  | Develop a predictive model to estimate residential property prices in King County, Seattle, using historical housing data.                                          |
| **Data Sources**               | Historical housing data from King County, Seattle, including property details such as square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.                           |
| **Key Features Analyzed**      | Square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, property condition, and age.                                                                            |
| **Technologies Used**          | Python for data handling and modeling, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, Scikit-Learn for machine learning models. |
| **Machine Learning Model**     | Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on selected features.                                                                                             |
| **Evaluation Metrics**         | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance.                                                                                           |
| **Findings**                   | Significant predictors include square footage and location, with central locations like downtown Seattle showing higher average prices.                             |
| **Future Enhancements**        | Experiment with additional models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest), add more features, and apply time-series analysis for market trend insights.               |
| **Example Prediction**         | For a 2500 sq ft home with 3 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, located in downtown Seattle, the predicted price is approximately $800,000.                                   |
