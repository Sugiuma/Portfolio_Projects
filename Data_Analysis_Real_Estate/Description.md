# Real Estate Market Price Prediction

## Overview
The **Real Estate Market Price Prediction** project focuses on developing a **data-driven model** to estimate residential property prices. Using **historical housing data from King County, Seattle**, this project analyzes various property features to predict housing prices accurately. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real estate, providing insights into factors affecting property values.

## Project Stages
1. **Data Collection**: Collected historical housing data for King County, Seattle, including details on property attributes.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify trends, and visualize relationships between features.
4. **Feature Selection**: Selected relevant features, including **square footage**, **number of bedrooms and bathrooms**, and **location** to improve model accuracy.
5. **Model Building**: Developed a predictive model using **linear regression** to estimate housing prices based on selected features.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R-squared (R²)** to ensure accurate predictions.

## Key Features Analyzed
- **Square Footage**: Total area of the property, which showed a strong positive correlation with price.
- **Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms**: Basic indicators of property size and capacity.
- **Location**: Factored in neighborhood and geographical region within King County, impacting pricing.
- **Property Condition and Age**: Included to account for property upkeep and depreciation.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Data cleaning and handling.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Visualization of data trends and feature relationships.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for machine learning model development and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Linear Regression**: Built a linear regression model to establish the relationship between housing features and market prices.
- **Model Tuning**: Fine-tuned the model to optimize predictive accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Assessed the average magnitude of prediction errors.
  - **R-squared (R²)**: Measured how well the model explained variance in housing prices.

## Example
- **Input Features**: 
  - Square Footage: 2500 sq ft
  - Bedrooms: 3
  - Bathrooms: 2.5
  - Location: Downtown Seattle
- **Predicted Price**: $800,000

## Findings
- **Significant Predictors**: Identified that **square footage** and **location** were among the most significant predictors of property prices.
- **Location Effect**: Properties in central locations, such as downtown Seattle, showed higher average prices than those in suburban areas.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a high R-squared value, indicating the model's effectiveness in capturing price variance.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Models**: Experiment with other models, such as Decision Trees and Random Forest, to potentially improve accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Include more features, like proximity to amenities and property type.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Integrate time-based trends to capture changes in market dynamics.

## Conclusion
This **Real Estate Market Price Prediction** project provides a valuable tool for estimating property prices based on critical factors. By leveraging **historical data** and **machine learning**, the model delivers reliable price predictions, benefiting stakeholders in the real estate industry.
