### Project: Summarize Your Private Data with Generative AI  

**Overview**  
This project focused on building an intelligent chatbot capable of analyzing and summarizing the contents of PDF files using advanced generative AI technologies. The chatbot leverages Meta's Llama 2 language model and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to generate contextually accurate and detailed responses.  

**Key Features**  
- **PDF Analysis and Summarization**: Users can upload a PDF file, and the chatbot answers questions about its content or provides summaries.  
- **Advanced Language Processing**: Utilized Llama 2, an open-access large language model, for natural language understanding and response generation.  
- **LangChain Integration**: Employed LangChain to simplify RAG implementation, enabling efficient data extraction, summarization, and complex language operations.  
- **Flask Backend**: Developed a Flask-based backend to handle HTTP requests and manage seamless interaction between the chatbot and users.  

**Skills Highlighted**  
- Expertise in LLMs and generative AI.  
- Proficiency in Flask for building web application backends.  
- Hands-on experience with LangChain for creating AI-driven solutions.  
- Application of RAG for enhanced data comprehension and summarization.  

This project demonstrates the practical application of generative AI technologies to process private data, making it easier to analyze and extract actionable insights from large documents.
