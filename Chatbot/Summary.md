### Project: Build Your Own ChatGPT-Like Website  

**Overview**  
This project involved creating a chatbot application that simulates human-like conversations using generative AI technology. The chatbot was built with Facebook’s Blenderbot model and Hugging Face’s Transformers library, demonstrating how natural language processing (NLP) enables chatbots to understand questions and generate meaningful responses.  

**Key Features**  
- **Transformer-Based Language Model**: Implemented a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) to process user inputs and generate human-like replies.  
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated key parameters such as licensing, model size, training data, and accuracy to select the appropriate LLM for the chatbot.  
- **Back-End Development**: Built and hosted a Flask-based back-end server to process prompts and handle communication between the user interface and the chatbot model.  
- **Web Interface Integration**: Transitioned the terminal-based chatbot into a user-friendly web application, enabling seamless interaction through a browser interface.  

**Skills Highlighted**  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI model integration.  
- Back-end development with Flask and Python.  
- Hosting and deploying AI-powered applications for web use.  

This project showcases expertise in developing conversational AI systems and integrating them into interactive web applications for practical use cases.
