| **Objective**                  | Develop a Python-based Tool Rental System to manage tool inventory, rentals, and customer details, with a focus on object-oriented programming (OOP). |
| **Key Features**               | - Tool inventory management (adding, updating, and deleting tools).<br>- Rental tracking (customer, rental duration, tool details).<br>- Return and late fee calculations. |
| **Technology Used**            | Python for backend logic, with an emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.                                            |
| **Core Classes**               | - **Tool**: Represents a tool with attributes like name, type, price, and availability.<br>- **Customer**: Represents a customer with rental history and personal details.<br>- **Rental**: Manages rental transactions, including tool, customer, and dates. |
| **User Interface**             | Command-line interface (CLI) allowing users to interact with the system for tool reservations, returns, and viewing inventory.         |
| **Rental System Features**     | - Allows users to rent tools for a specific duration.<br>- Handles returns and calculates late fees if tools are not returned on time. |
| **Example Usage**              | - **Add a Tool**: Add a new tool to the inventory (e.g., Hammer, available for $5/day).<br>- **Rent a Tool**: Rent a tool for 3 days and track rental details. |
| **Future Enhancements**        | - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.<br>- Add user authentication and role-based access (admin/customer).<br>- Integrate with a database for persistent storage. |
