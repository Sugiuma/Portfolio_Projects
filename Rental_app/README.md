Code Snippets
Displaying Available Stock
python
Copy code
shop = ToolRental({
    "sander": 10,
    "drill": 15,
    "circular saw": 5
})
shop.display_stock()
# Output:
# We have 10 sander(s) available to rent.
# We have 15 drill(s) available to rent.
# We have 5 circular saw(s) available to rent.
Renting a Tool
python
Copy code
rental_time = shop.rent_tool("drill", 2, "hourly")
# Output:
# You have rented 2 drill(s) on an hourly basis at 14 hours.
# You will be charged $4 per hourly per tool.
Returning a Tool
python
Copy code
# Assuming the rental was made one hour ago
bill = shop.return_tool("drill", rental_time, "hourly", 2)
print(f"Total bill: ${bill:.2f}")
# Output: Total bill: $8.00
Example
Here’s a sample interaction for renting and returning tools in the system:

python
Copy code
# Initialize inventory and customer
shop = ToolRental({
    "sander": 10,
    "drill": 15,
    "circular saw": 5
})
customer = Customer()

# Customer rents 2 drills on an hourly basis
customer.tool, customer.tools = "drill", 2
customer.rental_basis = "hourly"
customer.rental_time = shop.rent_tool("drill", 2, "hourly")

# Customer returns the tools after some time
bill = shop.return_tool("drill", customer.rental_time, customer.rental_basis, 2)
print(f"Total bill for returning tools: ${bill:.2f}")
