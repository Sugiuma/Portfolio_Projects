| Feature                              | Procedural                                                                                                        | OOP                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Initializing the Tool Inventory** | Inventory is maintained as a dictionary directly in the main code. Functions operate on this dictionary.          | Inventory is encapsulated within the `Rental` base class, making it part of the class's state.               |
| **Code Comparison**                  | ```python                                                                                                         | ```python                                                                                                    |
|                                      | inventory = {                                                                                                    | class Rental:                                                                                                 |
|                                      |     "sander": 10,                                                                                                |     def __init__(self, stock=None):                                                                          |
|                                      |     "drill": 15,                                                                                                |         if stock is None:                                                                                    |
|                                      |     "circular saw": 5                                                                                           |             stock = {}                                                                                       |
|                                      | }                                                                                                               |         self.stock = stock                                                                                   |
| **Benefit**                          | Functions modifying the inventory are external, leading to less encapsulation.                                   | Ensures only class methods can modify the stock, preventing unintended changes.                              |

| **2. Displaying Available Tools**    | A function is used to display the inventory dictionary.                                                          | A `display_stock` method is used within the `Rental` class. This keeps it reusable and extendable.            |
| **Code Comparison**                  | ```python                                                                                                         | ```python                                                                                                    |
|                                      | def display_stock(inventory):                                                                                   | class Rental:                                                                                                |
|                                      |     for tool, count in inventory.items():                                                                       |     def display_stock(self):                                                                                 |
|                                      |         print(f"We have {count} {tool}(s) available to rent.")                                                  |         for tool, count in self.stock.items():                                                               |
|                                      |                                                                                                                 |             print(f"We have {count} {tool}(s) available to rent.")                                           |
| **Benefit**                          | Function is not associated with any object, limiting reusability.                                               | Tied to the objectâ€™s state, making it easier to extend or modify.                                            |

| **3. Renting Tools**                 | Functions for each rental type handle logic separately (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).                            | A single `rent_tool` method in the `ToolRental` class handles all rental logic.                              |
| **Code Comparison**                  | ```python                                                                                                         | ```python                                                                                                    |
|                                      | def rent_hourly(tool, n, inventory):                                                                             | class ToolRental(Rental):                                                                                    |
|                                      |     # Code to rent by hour...                                                                                   |     def rent_tool(self, tool, n, basis):                                                                     |
|                                      | def rent_daily(tool, n, inventory):                                                                              |         # General method to rent by hourly, daily, or weekly basis                                           |
| **Benefit**                          | Redundant code for each rental type, harder to maintain and extend.                                              | Consolidates logic into a single method, reducing redundancy and improving flexibility.                      |

| **4. Returning Tools and Calculating Bill** | Separate functions for each rental type manage return and billing logic.                                         | A single `return_tool` method in the `ToolRental` class centralizes return and billing processes.             |
| **Code Comparison**                  | ```python                                                                                                         | ```python                                                                                                    |
|                                      | def return_hourly(tool, rental_time, inventory):                                                                 | class ToolRental(Rental):                                                                                    |
|                                      |     # Code to calculate hourly return...                                                                         |     def return_tool(self, tool, rental_time, rental_basis, n):                                               |
|                                      | def return_daily(tool, rental_time, inventory):                                                                  |         # Single method handles hourly, daily, and weekly returns                                            |
| **Benefit**                          | Harder to maintain consistency when updating billing logic.                                                      | Centralized logic simplifies updates and reduces duplication.                                                |

| **5. Customer Interaction and Tracking** | Customer data is stored and managed externally. Functions require multiple parameters to handle customer state.   | A `Customer` class encapsulates customer details, enabling organized tracking of their rental information.    |
| **Code Comparison**                  | ```python                                                                                                         | ```python                                                                                                    |
|                                      | def request_tool(inventory):                                                                                     | class Customer:                                                                                              |
|                                      |     # Code to handle customer request                                                                            |     def request_tool(self):                                                                                  |
|                                      |                                                                                                                 |         # Method to handle customer request                                                                  |
| **Benefit**                          | Requires external handling of customer data, leading to less cohesion.                                           | Encapsulation provides an organized structure, making customer management more efficient.                    |
