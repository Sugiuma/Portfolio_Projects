### **Wildfire Activities Analysis and Dashboard Project**  

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing wildfire activities in Australia using a wildfire dataset spanning from 2005 onward. The dataset includes information on fire activity metrics across seven regions, such as estimated fire area, brightness, radiative power, and confidence levels.

#### **Part 1: Analyzing Wildfire Activities in Australia**  
The objective is to explore patterns and trends in wildfire activities using data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Folium.  

**Tasks:**  
1. **Line Chart**: Analyze changes in average estimated fire area over time using Pandas.  
2. **Monthly Fire Area Trend**: Plot estimated fire area by month to observe seasonal variations.  
3. **Barplot**: Visualize the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across regions using Seaborn.  
4. **Pie Chart**: Show the proportion of pixel counts for presumed vegetation fires across regions.  
5. **Customized Pie Chart**: Enhance the visual representation of the above pie chart.  
6. **Histogram**: Develop a histogram of mean estimated fire brightness using Matplotlib.  
7. **Seaborn Distribution Plot**: Use region as a hue to explore estimated fire brightness distribution across regions.  
8. **Scatter Plot**: Investigate the correlation between mean estimated fire radiative power and mean confidence level.  
9. **Interactive Map**: Mark all seven wildfire-affected regions on the map of Australia using Folium.

#### **Part 2: Dashboard for Region and Year-Based Analysis**  
The second part involves building an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to visualize wildfire data based on user-selected regions and years.  

**Features:**  
- **Pie Chart**: Displays the monthly average estimated fire area.  
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the monthly average count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Add a dashboard title for clear context.  
2. Integrate user controls: radio buttons for region selection and a dropdown menu for year selection.  
3. Create dynamic output areas for displaying the charts.  
4. Implement input-output callbacks to make the dashboard interactive.  
5. Develop a callback function to filter data based on user input and update the charts dynamically.
