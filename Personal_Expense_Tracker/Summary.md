| **Objective**                  | Develop an expense tracker application that extracts transaction data from PDF bank statements, categorizes the expenses, and generates monthly reports. |
| **Key Features**               | - Extract data from PDF bank statements using Python.<br>- Categorize transactions into predefined categories (e.g., food, utilities, entertainment).<br>- Generate monthly spending reports and visualizations. |
| **Technology Used**            | Python (for PDF extraction and data processing), Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations), PyPDF2 or PDFplumber (for PDF parsing). |
| **Data Extraction**            | Uses libraries like **PDFplumber** or **PyPDF2** to extract transaction details from scanned or digitally-generated bank statements in PDF format. |
| **Categorization System**      | Classifies transactions into categories (e.g., groceries, rent, utilities) using simple keyword matching or user-defined rules.           |
| **Report Generation**          | Automatically generates monthly expense reports in PDF or Excel formats, with visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts showing spending patterns. |
| **Example Use Case**           | - A user uploads a PDF bank statement.<br>- The system extracts transactions, categorizes them, and generates a detailed report for the month. |
| **Future Enhancements**        | - Implement machine learning for automatic transaction categorization.<br>- Allow users to manually adjust categories or add custom ones.<br>- Integrate with financial APIs for real-time data tracking. |
