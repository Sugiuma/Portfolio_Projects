# E-Commerce Web Application

## Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce web application built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. It features an intuitive product catalog, secure user authentication, an interactive shopping cart, and an admin panel for managing products and orders.

## Key Features & Flask Components

### Product Catalog Display
- The homepage displays a product catalog with images, descriptions, and prices.
- Products are retrieved from the database using SQLAlchemy and displayed in a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap.
- Each product has an "Add to Cart" option, allowing customers to specify quantities and add products to their cart.

### User Authentication
- Users can log in as either **admin** or **customer**, with different views and access permissions for each role.
- User credentials are stored securely using password hashing (Werkzeug).
- Flask sessions manage login states and user sessions.

### Admin Panel for Product Management
- Admin users can add, edit, and delete products.
- Admin-specific routes are protected with the `admin_required` decorator to restrict access.
- Admins can manage product details, including uploading product images and updating inventory.

### Shopping Cart Functionality
- Users can add products to the cart, with quantity and total cost details displayed.
- The cart is stored in the user's session, allowing them to continue shopping or proceed to checkout.

### Checkout & Order Processing
- The checkout page allows users to review their cart and make payments using a mock payment processor.
- Upon successful payment, order details are saved to the database as an order record.
- Users receive a confirmation message upon successful order submission.

### Product Image Upload
- Admins can upload product images, which are saved to the server and associated with the respective products.
- Images are served from the `/static/uploads/` folder and displayed alongside product details.

### Responsive Design
- The app is responsive, with product images displayed in a grid layout that adjusts according to screen size.
- Bootstrap is used to ensure a consistent and mobile-friendly UI.

### Error Handling & Flash Messages
- The application provides feedback using flash messages for successful actions (e.g., adding products, successful login) and errors (e.g., invalid login credentials, insufficient stock).
- Custom error pages handle 404 errors gracefully.

### Database Integration (SQLAlchemy)
- SQLAlchemy is used for managing and querying the database, including tables for `Product`, `User`, and `Order`.
- Relationships between products and orders are managed using foreign keys.

### File Upload Management
- Supports uploading and validating images with allowed extensions like PNG, JPG, and JPEG.
- Product images are stored in a dedicated folder (`static/uploads/`) and served dynamically using Flask’s `url_for()` function.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask** for the web framework
- **SQLAlchemy** for database interaction
- **Jinja2** for templating engine
- **Werkzeug** for secure password handling
- **Bootstrap** for frontend styling
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for managing database models


To provide an overview of key parts of the e-commerce application, here are a few essential code snippets that demonstrate critical features like product management, user authentication, shopping cart handling, and the admin dashboard.


# 1. User Authentication (login route)
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, flash, session
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

        if user and check_password_hash(user.password, password):
            session['user_id'] = user.id
            session['is_admin'] = user.is_admin
            flash("Login successful!", "success")
            return redirect(url_for('admin_dashboard') if user.is_admin else url_for('catalog'))
        else:
            flash("Invalid username or password", "danger")
    return render_template('login.html')

# 2. Admin Product Management (Add, Edit, Delete Product)
@app.route('/admin/add_product', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@admin_required  # Custom decorator to restrict access to admins
def add_product():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        price = float(request.form['price'])
        description = request.form['description']
        image = request.files['image']
        
        # Save image and add product to the database
        if image:
            image_path = save_image(image)
            new_product = Product(name=name, price=price, description=description, image_path=image_path)
            db.session.add(new_product)
            db.session.commit()
            flash('Product added successfully!', 'success')
            return redirect(url_for('admin_dashboard'))
    return render_template('admin/add_product.html')

# 3. Shopping Cart Management
@app.route('/add_to_cart/<int:product_id>', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def add_to_cart(product_id):
    quantity = int(request.form['quantity'])
    cart = session.get('cart', {})
    cart[product_id] = cart.get(product_id, 0) + quantity
    session['cart'] = cart
    flash("Product added to cart!", "success")
    return redirect(url_for('cart'))

@app.route('/cart')
def cart():
    cart = session.get('cart', {})
    products = Product.query.filter(Product.id.in_(cart.keys())).all()
    total = sum(product.price * quantity for product, quantity in zip(products, cart.values()))
    return render_template('cart.html', products=products, total=total)

# 4. Checkout and Order Processing
@app.route('/checkout', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@login_required
def checkout():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        cart = session.get('cart', {})
        order = Order(user_id=session['user_id'])
        
        for product_id, quantity in cart.items():
            product = Product.query.get(product_id)
            order_item = OrderItem(order=order, product=product, quantity=quantity)
            db.session.add(order_item)
        
        db.session.add(order)
        db.session.commit()
        
        # Clear the cart after order submission
        session.pop('cart', None)
        flash("Order placed successfully!", "success")
        return redirect(url_for('catalog'))
    return render_template('checkout.html')

# 5. Admin Dashboard with Product Management Links
@app.route('/admin_dashboard')
@admin_required
def admin_dashboard():
    products = Product.query.all()
    orders = Order.query.all()
    return render_template('admin/dashboard.html', products=products, orders=orders)
```
## Explanation of Key Components
- **User Authentication**: Uses session management to track login states, with password security handled by Werkzeug’s hashing functions.
- **Admin Product Management**: Allows the admin to add, edit, and delete products via custom routes, with role-restricted access controlled by a custom @admin_required decorator.
- **Shopping Cart Management**: Manages the cart contents within the session, ensuring that products and quantities persist as users navigate.
- **Checkout and Order Processing**: Creates an order record with associated items in the database and clears the cart session upon successful order placement.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Displays product and order details with links for admins to edit or delete products, providing a central control hub for management tasks.
